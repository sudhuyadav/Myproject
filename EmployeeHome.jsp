                        speedex.com is the India’s leading parcel delivery comparison website,
                        housing 150+ employees within our offices based in India,
                         and have an annual turnover over £35 million dealing with 1.2 million
                         customers!

We have over 10 years’ experience in the parcel industry and
have built up a state of the art  that no other competitor can rival.

Therefore we want to remain at the top and continue to be industry leaders and
in order to do so we need to recruit the best people for the job!

We may have potential opportunities arising within our expanding Marketing
and IT teams such as UX/UI Designers, Web Analysts, Digital Marketing Managers, Web Graphic
Designers and Web Developers.
As you can see, these roles are yet to be fully defined but that doesn’t mean 
they have to be! Maybe you possess certain skills and qualities that we have not thought
of yet? Nevertheless the salary for each role will be very competitive.

If you have solid experience within these roles then please forward a
speculative CV, Cover Letter and any portfolio work (for UX/UI Designers, Web Analytics,
Web Graphic Designers) to Hiring Manager at recruitment@speedex.com and state the position 
you wish to apply for and a salary range you are looking for.

We will try and respond to all applicants. However, due to large volumes this isn’t
always possible. If you haven’t heard from us within 14 days, please assume 
you are unsuccessful for the upcoming roles. Thank you for your interest in advance.
