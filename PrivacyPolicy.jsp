                       to do so by law.

  Safety guidelines
  
</h4>
The Platform is always reaching out to a wider audience by showcasing the best of our
member contributions. However, in doing so, we will not allow to be uploaded anything
on the site that we think could be potentially endangering or is inflammatory or
embarrassing to our members. It also helps members to be aware of certain things in 
the interest of their safety.
All members are responsible for the safety of their personal information. 
We recommend that members do not disclose their names, addresses, email addresses, 
telephone numbers or other personal information online.
All members need to be aware that when they upload their photos on the Platform, 
the photos are not only visible to the entire internet community but can also 
be downloaded, since any image that can be displayed on a computer screen can be 
saved by the person viewing it. It is technically not possible to prevent this and
hence speedex cannot be held liable in such cases. If you are worried about
someone else viewing or saving your images then please do not submit them.
Do not post chain letters, promote pyramid schemes or recruit members for
any network marketing or multilevel marketing businesses.
Do not recruit members to join another website forum or chat group, 
whether personal or otherwise. If you have a suggestion for a new forum,
please contact us or send your queries to member relations.
